## Project Overview
In this project, I will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

The following questions will be answered in this project:
-  How many times were the movies in each categories under the family movies genre rented out?
- In the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for each month, Is there a significant difference in the count of rentals? If so, which store has the highest number of rental fulfilled overall?
- What is the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category?
- What are the full names of the top 10 paying customers? What are the months and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?
